What the hell have I been thinking?” Looking to correct the opportunity I nearly missed, I immediately started searching programs through my university and found one at the Danish Institute of Study Abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark that advertised a 7-week Graphic Design studio and my heart told me that’s where I’d be going that summer."

Though I had a little training in graphic design through my minor in Technology, Arts & Media, up to this point, I was almost entirely self-taught. I was pumped to try out my design skills, but even more than that, I relished the opportunity to learn from people who actually knew what they were doing."

The store was founded in 1994 by Rasmus Storm, who had the vision to provide fashionable accessories and lifestyle items to men. Over time, however, it has evolved into the exhibition of culture it is today."

					p: "When I asked him about what drove his inspiration for the store, he paused thoughtfully and replied, “it is just a feeling. I get a gut feeling about whether or not to include any particular item in my store.” And from that moment, I recognized it was my job to discover that feeling and channel it through my designs."

The store played loud music and sported a certain musk, but neither were overpowering. It was a sanctuary. A place that seemed to be laid out for each and every customer that walked through the door."

We were also to create a poster and a window sticker that would promote an upcoming event to be held by Storm. And finally, we had to design a shirt to be sold as merchandise in the store."

					{
						title: {
							primary: "Logo",

						p: "One unique thing about Storm’s current image was his rare use of pink and orange. The colors don’t show up in his store except for in the extremely hot pink and hot orange shopping bags he uses. He explained the choice was a business decision because you can see the bags from a mile away (though he probably said kilometer). I thought that was clever, so I wanted to keep the pink and orange on the bags. My goal was to keep the pink and orange, but introduce another visual element: the stripes from the three crosswalks outside his door."

You are essentially handing yourself to someone in the form of a 50x85mm piece of paper and expect them to understand or at least remember who you are. Since this transaction is a chance for a personal connection, I decided to add a little sentiment in the form of a phrase meant to be reminiscent of the closing of a letter \"Keep In Touch, Storm.\""

							secondary: "Personable, Gracious"
						},
						p: "The purpose of the bag sticker is to close a small clear plastic bag that the store gives out for smaller purchases like jewelry or books. I chose to use the same idea as the business card and include a little phrase to emphasize the personal side of a routine business transaction. It is meant to thank the customer for their business and let them know they are appreciated. By adding the sticker to the bag, Storm is saying \"you came to my store and I thank you, take this item with love, and feel welcome back at anytime.\""

						},
						p: "The shirt was my personal favorite to design. Much of the merchandise in the store comes without many frills. It is often plainly colored with a simple symbol or message on the front, and this shirt would be no exception. However, this shirt is special because from far away, the shirt appears to be plain black, perhaps with five small white dots (the illegible letters) on the front. But as you approach the wearer into their personal range the pattern and text become legible and the shirt comes alive with its quality revealed."

							secondary: "Spotlights Guest Companies, Memorable"
						},
						p: "Storm was planning an event called “Storm & Family” which would feature 4 Los Angeles-based brands in an exhibition. Since the event was featuring other brands, my main goal was to give each company its time in the spotlight, but still recognize that they were part of the \"family.\" The idea hit me early on to have a model walking down the runway with an article of clothing from each company. Like individual parts becoming a whole, this would give each company their part but they also form Storm’s family."

Visually, the ad would have a great impact on someone walking across the street from the store. I could imagine them exclaiming something similar to \"Whoa! What is that man chopped in 4 parts doing on that window?\""
